# Introduction

This repository contains the Quarto source files of the practical exercises for the *Introduction to the British Social Attitudes Surveys* UKDS Data Skills Module.


The BSA tracks the views and opinions of the public on national issues over time. The BSA questionnaire has core questions that are repeated in most years. These cover different topics such as politics, welfare, poverty,  health, education, equalities, and employment alongside various background and demographic questions.
It also includes  non-core questions (modules) on a number of social, political, economic and moral topics, which are included  periodically  in the survey.
